## Cross-layer data contracts

- Any payload sent between the client and server must have its TypeScript interfaces or types defined under `packages/shared/src`.
- Do not introduce duplicate or local-only versions of these contracts inside client or server source files; instead import them via the `@shared/*` aliases.
- When a new API endpoint needs additional fields, update the shared model first, re-export it through `packages/shared/src/index.ts`, and then consume it from both client and server.
- Keep helper-specific view models inside feature modules only when they are derived from shared models (e.g., UI-only shapes). Raw API responses/request bodies always reference shared definitions.
