## CORS Guardrails

- The Bun/Hono server must accept browser calls from the Vite dev server running on `http://localhost:5173`.
- Keep the `cors` middleware mounted before any routes and ensure `origin` explicitly includes that port so the client search + detail fetchers work during development.
- If you need to support more origins later, extend the allow-list here instead of removing the middleware.
